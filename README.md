# 8-bit-Comparator
A VHDL code for comparing 2 8-bit numbers signed and unsigned with testing techniques 


In this project, an 8 bit both signed and unsigned comparator was assembled structurally, from basic logic gates with specific delays, and then blocks of the comparator itself assembled from these gates. After that, both a value generation entity and a value analyzer entity was built in order to test out the results of all possible values entering the comparator. 

In this Repo, you can find all VHDL files alongside a report of the work and simulation snapshots.
